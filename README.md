# PyTesseract_Tutorial

PyTesseract is the python library that is used to detect text out of an image.
First we need to install the tesseract-ocr.exe file which is available at https://github.com/ub-mannheim/tesseract/wiki. 
We need to install the required libraries i.e. opencv-python and pytesseract. 
Then we can load an image and extract the text written in it.
